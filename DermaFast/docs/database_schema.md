INSERT INTO question_definitions (question_key, question_text) VALUES
  ('q1', 'When you look at the mole, does one half look different from the other half in shape or thickness?'),
  ('q2', 'Have you noticed if the edges of the mole look ragged, notched, or blurred rather than smooth?'),

  ('q4', 'Would you say it is larger than about 6 millimeters, roughly the size of a pencil eraser?'),

# `HAM10000_for_comparison` Bucket

This Supabase Storage bucket contains a curated subset of mole images from the **HAM10000 dataset**.

## Purpose

The images in this bucket are used to:

- Compare uploaded user mole images against labeled training images.
- Support **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** search for similar moles.
- Enable embedding-based similarity in the decision-making process.

## Content

- **870 images** selected from the original dataset. 50% for them are of melenoma.
- Stored in `.jpg` format.
- Images are named using their `image_id` (e.g., `ISIC_0031434.jpg`).
- Publicly accessible via Supabase storage.

## Storage Size

- Average size per image: ~300 KB  
- Total size: ~250 MB

## Access & Metadata

Each image in the bucket corresponds to a row in the `ham_metadata` table in the database, which includes:

- `image_id`: unique identifier
- `image_url`: full public URL to the image in this bucket
- `dx`: diagnosis label (e.g., `mel`, `nv`)
- Other metadata (e.g., `lesion_id`, `age`, `sex`, `localization`)


## `cnn_results` - Table

This table stores the output of the CNN model after a user uploads a mole image. It includes the binary classification result and the embedding vector used for similarity search.
- The `embedding` vector will later be used for **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** retrieval to compare uploaded mole images with a training set.
- `cnn_result` represents the **likelihood** (between 0 and 1) of the mole being melanoma.

**Schema**

| Column Name | Type         | Description                                                  |

| `national_id`   | `Varchar(255)` | Foreign key referencing `users(id)`                    |
| `timestamp` | `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Time of prediction (defaults to `now()`)                    |
| `cnn_result`| `FLOAT`      | Pribability of the mole to be melanoma               |
| `embedding` | `FLOAT[]`    | 2D embedding vector from the CNNâ€™s dropout layer    |
